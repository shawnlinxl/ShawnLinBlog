# UI Framework


[Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) offers a beautiful UI framework. You can build a decent website up and running in no time with it. It has a lot of elements built in, and it's also very well documented.

```sh
npm install --save semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css
```
#### Alternatives

[Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)  (Google)
[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
[Ant Design](https://ant.design/) (Alibaba)
[Fabric](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric) (Microsoft)
[Altas Kit](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/) (Atlassian)

# Tables

After doing some research, I found [React Bootstrap Table 2](https://react-bootstrap-table.github.io/react-bootstrap-table2/docs/about.html). It's feature rich and very well documented. Note that at the current moment you'll need to import Bootstrap's CSS in your html file.

```sh
npm install --save react-bootstrap-table-next
```

# Date Picker

[React Datepicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/) is beautiful and easy to use.

[React Dates (Airbnb)](https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates)

# Date Converstion

[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) is pretty much the go-to library for any date time conversion in javascirpt.

```sh
npm install --save moment
```

# Select menu

[React Select](https://react-select.com/home)

```sh
npm install --save react-select
```

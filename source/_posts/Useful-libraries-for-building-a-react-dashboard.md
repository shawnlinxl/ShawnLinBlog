# UI Framework


[Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) offers a beautiful UI framework. You can build a decent website up and running in no time with it. It has a lot of elements built in, and it's also very well documented.

```sh
npm install --save semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css
```

# Tables

After doing some research, I found [React Bootstrap Table 2](https://react-bootstrap-table.github.io/react-bootstrap-table2/docs/about.html). It's feature rich and very well documented. Note that at the current moment you'll need to import Bootstrap's CSS in your html file.

```sh
npm install --save react-bootstrap-table-next
```

# Date Picker

[React Datepicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/) is beautiful and easy to use.
